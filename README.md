This code is made for btute forcing passwords in a somewhat fast manner.
This is made to be changed and configured however it is wanted.
current_version is used for a password when the username is known and it is numbers that needs to be guessed.
This program was made with a website in mind and does work very well with its limitations.

Run this with the most recent version of python and windows (works with different OS but is done differently).
You need the selenium library installed (use "pip install selenium" in the windows command prompt).
Additionally a chrome webdriver is needed (https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) and google chrome installed.
The code is created for google chrome but can be used with other browsers with some small code changes.
If you want to gives changes/ideas feel free to add them to current_version with comments to explain the code, I would love to learn.

I recommend reading the base_code first for getting an understanding of the code used.
The base_code is the first working version of the code that could be used to brute force.
The base_code is reused in later versions with some changes to how it works and bigger changes to how its used.


current_version can be a little confusing but is mostly just the same thing copy and pasted 20 times.
This is the version of the code that works best and has all the latest features. 
The goal for this project is to get every/most passwords cracked in less than 30 minutes if username is known and 4 numbers are used.
This is done through the use of 20 browsers to cycle the loading times and increase the speed of the program.
I understand that the project is a bit unpolished and could be optimized, I am still fairly new to programming.
