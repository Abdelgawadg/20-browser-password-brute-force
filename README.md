Code is used for the brute forcing of passwords of raypec tyler sis users who are in the classes of 2021 and 2023.

This is done through a few small oversights.
The first is that you can find usernames though gmail reducing the amount of characters to be guessed by 3.
The second is that there is a simple password protocol that is (mostly) consistent.
The password protocol is somewhat different though different years but they all follow the same scheme.
The protocol for the class of 21 is "rp21" + 4 random characters, and the freshman class is the same but with "bike" instead.
This reduces the amount of password possibiliteis



Run this with the most recent version of python and windows (works with different OS but is done differently).
You need the selenium library installed (use "pip install selenium" in the windows command prompt).
Additionally a chrome webdriver is needed (https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) and google chrome installed.
The code is created for google chrome but can be used with other browsers with some small code changes.
If you want to gives changes/ideas feel free to add them to current_version with comments to explain the code, I would love to learn.

I recommend reading the base_code first for getting an understanding of the code used.
The base_code is the first working version of the code that could be used to brute force.
The base_code is reused in later versions with some changes to how it works and bigger changes to how its used.

current_version can be a little confusing but is mostly just the same thing copy and pasted 20 times.
This is the version of the code that works best and has all the latest features. 
The goal for this project is to get every/most passwords cracked in less than 30 minutes.
I understand that the project is a bit unpolished and could be optimized, I am still fairly new to programming.
